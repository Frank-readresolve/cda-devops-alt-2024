# Algorithmix-JS
The training goal of these exercises is to learn how to read and write a simple program, how to translate requirements expressed in a natural language into a small computer program, then to learn or strenghten the basics of JavaScript which is the implementation language as it is a requirement to build Web applications at least for the user interface.

## Prerequisites
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current), a JavaScript execution environment
- A code editor, typically [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for JavaScript
- Git [installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) with [basic knowledge of Git](https://git-scm.com/docs) itself and GitHub (here!)
- Basic usage of a [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI)
- A deep desire to [solve problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) and become a developer!

## How is it organised? General considerations
Each folder contains the "Specifications and constraints" for a single exercise written in a `README.md` file; most of the time some input/output examples are also given.

Read carefully the specifications and constraints, you must obey to them :P! **Make sure you have understood each intruction and the problem** described before trying to solve it. Do not interpret! Ask your colleagues first then trainer if needed to clear up ambiguities or misunderstandings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unless otherwise stated, JavaScript built-in functions ar not allowed! In other words, build-in functions are listed in the `README.md` when they are allowed.

## How-to?
A simple "hello world"-like example is provided in the first `000-hw` folder. We'll figure it out and run it together.

## Exercise categories

### Big bang
Only the specifications and constraints are present in the exercise's folder. You have to create a new separate file for the implementation of the solution.

### Fill in the blanks
Specifications and constraints are present in the exercise's folder as usual, but with an incomplete solution, a skeleton `run.js`. The provided script may contain additional instructions, usually in the form of comments; you must follow these instructions as those expressed in the related `README.md`.

> [!TIP]
> Copy-paste the code into your local file then complete the exercise.

### Where's Wally? ("OÃ¹ est Charlie" in french/France)
"Wally" is a bug. This category provides a "complete" solution but the solution is buggy. So your job in this case is to fix the bug.
